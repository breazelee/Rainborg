# Project Proposal: A Framework for User-Controlled Fluid Animation

We are interested in creating an interactive SPH fluid simulation using control
particles manipulated via keyframe animation by the user. The implementation of
the fluid simulation and the control system would come from previous work [1][]
[2][] [3][], we would additionally implement a user interface through which the
user can create and control these animations.
